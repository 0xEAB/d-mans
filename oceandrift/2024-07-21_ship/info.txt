Created for the “dlang-dockerized” project to be used as its avatar.

Note: `d-man_cargo-ship.svg` is an Inkscape-SVG file.
You might want to reduce it to plain SVG for further use.

The original sketch was drawn using the “Simple Draw” app on my phone.
It’s included here as bonus (`d-man_ship-sketch.svg`).
